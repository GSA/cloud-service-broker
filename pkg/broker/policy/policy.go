package policy

/*
  Package policy defines a way to create simple cascading rule systems similar
	to CSS.

	A policy is broken into two parts, conditions and declarations. Conditions
	are the test that is run when it'd determined if a rule should fire.
	Declarations are the values that are set by the rule.

	Rules are executed in a low to high precidence order, and values are merged
	with the values from higher precidence rules overwriting values with the same
	keys that were set earlier.

	Rules systems can be painfully difficult to debug and test. This is especially
	true because they're often built as a safe way for non-programmers to modify
	business process and don't have any way to programatically assert their logic
	without resorting to hand-testing.

	To combat this issue, this rules system introduces three separate concepts.

	1. Conditions are all a strict equality check.
	2. Rules are executed from top-to-bottom, eliminating the need for complex
	   state analysis and backtracking algorithms.
	3. There is a built-in system for assertion checking that's exposed to the
	   rule authors.
